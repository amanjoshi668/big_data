      "A medical call at a north Houston motel Thursday turned into an arrest for human trafficking of a minor.The Harris County Precinct 4 Office responded to a medical call in the 1600 block of North Freeway at a Super 8 Motel.The medical call was from a guest with a health issue, but the person told responders something suspicious was going on in another room.According to Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman, deputies found 29-year-old Allen Lee Auston in a nearby motel room with a 26-year-old woman, a 2-year-old child, and a 14-year-old girl who had been listed as a runaway.Herman said the girl ran away from home about a month ago.\"She began to give a false name, and long story short, she ended up being a runaway from a small town about a hundred miles outside Houston,\" he said.Herman believes the girl was \"groomed\" by Auston to make money for him.\"Through their investigation, they were able to determine the girl had been used for sexual purposes and he had basically been pimping her out on the streets of north Harris County,\" he said.After a brief investigation, deputies arrested Auston and charged him with human trafficking of a minor, compelling prostitution of a minor and aggravated promotion of prostitution.In court, the charging document that was read indicated the three women were taken to a section of Bissonett referred to as the 'blaze,' known for prostitution.The manager of the Super 8 Motel said Auston had checked in about three days prior. Two days before, he said a girl and another woman had tried to break into his truck. He didn't know if it was the same people who were staying with him.Auston, who has a criminal record dating back nine years in Harris County, is being held in jail without bond.The 14-year-old runaway was taken to Texas Children's Hospital for assessment. Herman said her parents were told she had been found and were taking her back home. The 26-year-old woman and child were also taken into custody.\n"

    "text = \"\"\"The Taliban said the bombing late Thursday, which tore a massive crater in the road and overturned cars, was a \"revenge attack\" for US air strikes this month in the volatile province of Kunduz that left 32 civilians dead.\n",
    "The explosion, followed by sporadic gunfire, reverberated across the usually tranquil northern city, smashing windows of nearby shops and leaving terrified local residents fleeing for cover.\n",
    "\"The suicide attacker rammed his explosives-laden car into the wall of the German consulate,\" local police chief Sayed Kamal Sadat told AFP.\n",
    "All German staff from the consulate were unharmed, according to the foreign ministry in Berlin.\n",
    "But seven Afghan civilians were killed, including two motorcyclists who were shot dead by German forces close to the consulate after they refused to heed their warning to stop, said deputy police chief Abdul Razaq Qadri.\n",
    "A suspect had also been detained near the diplomatic mission on Friday morning, Qadri added.\n",
    "Local doctor Noor Mohammad Fayez said the city hospitals received six dead bodies, including two killed by bullets.\n",
    "At least 128 others were wounded, some of them critically and many with shrapnel injuries, he added.\n",
    "\"The consulate building has been heavily damaged,\" the German foreign ministry said in a statement. \"Our sympathies go out to the Afghan injured and their families.\"\n",
    "A diplomatic source in Berlin said Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had convened a crisis meeting.\n",
    "\"There was fighting outside and on the grounds of the consulate,\" a ministry spokesman said. \"Afghan security forces and Resolute Support (NATO) forces from Camp Marmal (German base in Mazar-i-Sharif) are on the scene.\"\n",
    "Afghan special forces have cordoned off the consulate, previously well-known as Mazar Hotel, as helicopters flew over the site and ambulances with wailing sirens rushed to the area after the explosion.\n",
    "The carnage underscores worsening insecurity in Afghanistan as Taliban insurgents ramp up nationwide attacks despite repeated government attempts to jump-start stalled peace negotiations.\n",
    "Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the \"martyrdom attack\" on the consulate had left \"tens of invaders\" dead. The insurgents routinely exaggerate battlefield claims.\n",
    "Posting a Google Earth image of the consulate on Twitter, Mujahid said the assault was in retaliation for American air strikes in Kunduz.\n",
    "US forces conceded last week that its air strikes \"very likely\" resulted in civilian casualties in Kunduz, pledging a full investigation into the incident.\n",
    "The strikes killed several children, after a Taliban assault left two American soldiers and three Afghan special forces soldiers dead near Kunduz city.\n",
    "The strikes triggered impassioned protests in Kunduz city, with the victims' relatives parading mutilated bodies of dead children piled into open trucks through the streets.\n",
    "Civilian casualties caused by NATO forces have been one of the most contentious issues in the 15-year campaign against the insurgents, prompting strong public and government criticism.\n",
    "The country's worsening conflict has prompted US forces to step up air strikes to support their struggling Afghan counterparts, fuelling the perception that they are increasingly being drawn back into the conflict.\n",
    "The latest attack in Mazar-i-Sharif comes just two days after a bitter US presidential election.\n",
    "Afghanistan got scarcely a passing mention in the election campaign - even though the situation there will be an urgent matter for the new president.\n",
    "President-elect Donald Trump is set to inherit America's longest war with no end in sight.\n",
